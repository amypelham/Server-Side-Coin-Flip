# Server-Side-Coin-Flip
Simple coin flip game where the randomization happens server side

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, VS Code, Node.js


## Optimizations

The CSS and HTML files could use some love. I purposefully kept them simple in order to focus on the JavaScript side of things. If I redid this I'd add more form to my function.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a great opportunity to play with switch case statements.
